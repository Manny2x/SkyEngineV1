# Sky Engine (Version 1.0)
A raycaster engine built in 100% pure Java Swing. My largest project to date. However, there are some issues with the engine that I am not happy about, therefore I will be re writing it from scratch again.

* Programmed By: Aiden Thakurdial
* Textures are not mine, the wall textures are property of Wolfenstein 3D. The sky texture was found off of Google Images.
